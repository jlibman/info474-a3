##Describe the data domain and storyboard interactive visualization techniques you will use.
Start either by choosing a data domain or choosing the interactive visualization techniques you will implement. Think about why the domain and the techniques are a good match for one another. Then write a description of data domain and the interactive visualization application you will build. The description should include a storyboard of the interface/displays you will create. Be sure to explain the features of your application. Most importantly you should explain why the interaction techniques you will implement will be effective in the context of your data domain. The goal of this exercise is to think through the various concerns that go into the software implementation. This is why it is important that you perform this task first, before actually building the software.

##Part 1
I chose to use a dataset about precipitation in Seattle from 1948-2017, obtained from Kaggle. I am going to implement an interactive scatter plot where user initially sees all of the dates in the dataset graphed with the amount of precipitation on that day. The user will be able to choose a specific year and/or month to view from a dropdown menu. The visualization will then animate the adjustment of the axes.
